Themes
======

EmulationStation allows each system to have its own "theme." A theme is a collection **views** that define some **elements**, each with their own **properties**.

The first place ES will check for a theme is in the system's `<path>` folder, for a theme.xml file:
* `[SYSTEM_PATH]/theme.xml`

If that file doesn't exist, ES will try to find the theme in the current **theme set**.  Theme sets are just a collection of individual system themes arranged in the "themes" folder under some name.  A theme set can provide a default theme that will be used if there is no matching system theme.  Here are examples :

```
...
   themes/
      my_theme_set/
         snes/
            theme.xml
            my_cool_background.jpg
         nes/
            theme.xml
            my_other_super_cool_background.jpg
         common_resources/
            scroll_sound.wav

         theme.xml (Default theme)
...         
      another_theme_set/
         resources/            
            snes-logo.svg
            snes-back.jpg
            nes-logo.svg            
            nes-back.jpg
         theme.xml (Default theme)
```

The theme set system makes it easy for users to try different themes and allows distributions to include multiple theme options.  Users can change the currently active theme set in the "UI Settings" menu.  The option is only visible if at least one theme set exists.

There are places where ES can load theme sets from:

Windows :

* `[HOME]/.emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`
* `[HOME]/.emulationstation/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/theme.xml`

Linux :

* `/userdata/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/[SYSTEM_THEME]/theme.xml`
* `/userdata/themes/[CURRENT_THEME_SET]/theme.xml`

`[SYSTEM_THEME]` is the `<theme>` tag for the system, as defined in `es_systems.cfg`.  If the `<theme>` tag is not set, ES will use the system's `<name>`.

If both files happen to exist, ES will pick the first one (the one located in the home directory).

Again, the `[CURRENT_THEME_SET]` value is set in the "UI Settings" menu.  If it has not been set yet or the previously selected theme set is missing, the first available theme set will be used as the default.

Simple Example
==============

Here is a very simple theme that changes the description text's color:

```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<color>00FF00</color>
		</text>
		<image name="my_image" extra="true">
			<pos>0.5 0.5</pos>
			<origin>0.5 0.5</origin>
			<size>0.8 0.8</size>
			<path>./my_art/my_awesome_image.jpg</path>
		</image>
	</view>
</theme>
```

How it works
============

Everything must be inside a `<theme>` tag.

**The `<formatVersion>` tag *must* be specified**.  This is the version of the theming system the theme was designed for.  
The current version is 7 for batocera-emulationstation.  

Version 4 themes are Retropie & Recalbox themes - see their documentations for version 4 themes.


A *view* can be thought of as a particular "display" within EmulationStation.  Views are defined like this:

```xml
<view name="ViewNameHere">
	... define elements here ...
</view>
```



An *element* is a particular visual element, such as an image or a piece of text.  You can either modify an element that already exists for a particular view (as is done in the "description" example), like this:

```xml
	<elementTypeHere name="ExistingElementNameHere">
		... define properties here ...
	</elementTypeHere>
```

Or, you can create your own elements by adding `extra="true"` (as is done in the "my_image" example) like this:

```xml
	<elementTypeHere name="YourUniqueElementNameHere" extra="true">
		... define properties here ...
	</elementTypeHere>
```

"Extra" elements will be drawn in the order they are defined (so define backgrounds first!).  When they get drawn relative to the pre-existing elements depends on the view.  Make sure "extra" element names do not clash with existing element names!  An easy way to protect against this is to just start all your extra element names with some prefix like "e_".



*Properties* control how a particular *element* looks - for example, its position, size, image path, etc.  The type of the property determines what kinds of values you can use.  You can read about the types below in the "Reference" section.  Properties are defined like this:

```xml
		<propertyNameHere>ValueHere</propertyNameHere>
```



** BATOCERA 5.24 :

A *customView* can be thought of as a custom "gamelist view" within EmulationStation. 
Custom Views must inherit one of the standard views (basic, detailed, video or grid) or inherit from another custom view. Custom view inherit every element, attribute and behaviour of its parent view, so only differences or changes are needed.

It is defined like this :

```xml
<customView name="ViewNameHere" inherits="BaseViewNameHere">
	... define elements here ...
</customView>
```



Advanced Features
=================

It is recommended that if you are writing a theme you launch EmulationStation with the `--windowed` switches.  This way you can read error messages without having to check the log file.  You can also reload the current gamelist view and system view with `F5` 

### The `<include>` tag

You can include theme files within theme files, similar to `#include` in C (though the internal mechanism is different, the effect is the same).  Example:

`~/.emulationstation/all_themes.xml`:

```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>4</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<fontPath>./all_themes/myfont.ttf</fontPath>
			<color>00FF00</color>
		</text>
	</view>
</theme>
```

`~/.emulationstation/snes/theme.xml`:

```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>4</formatVersion>
	<include>./../all_themes.xml</include>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<color>FF0000</color>
		</text>
	</view>
</theme>
```

Is equivalent to this `snes/theme.xml`:
```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>4</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<text name="description">
			<fontPath>./all_themes/myfont.ttf</fontPath>
			<color>FF0000</color>
		</text>
	</view>
</theme>
```

Notice that properties that were not specified got merged (`<fontPath>`) and the `snes/theme.xml` could overwrite the included files' values (`<color>`).  Also notice the included file still needed the `<formatVersion>` tag.

### Subsets : Create theme variations declaring subsets

** Batocera 5.24

Subset are usefull to create multiple variations in a theme ( colorsets, iconsets, different system views...)

When a subset is defined, you can choose one of the named elements in the subset. Only one is active at a time. Only the active item is included, the other includes of the same subset are ignored.

"name" attribute must be unique among all includes. 

Common subsets are "colorset", "iconset", "menu", "systemview" or "gamelistview", but you can also add your custom subset names.

```xml
<theme>
	<include subset="colorset" name="nice colors">./../nice_colors.xml</include>
	<include subset="colorset" name="other colors" >./../other_colors.xml</include>
	
	<include subset="systemview" name="nice systemview">./../nice_sys.xml</include>
	<include subset="systemview" name="new carousel" >./../carousel.xml</include>
	
	<include subset="mycustomsubset" name="my choice">./../choice1.xml</include>
	<include subset="mycustomsubset" name="my other choice" >./../choice2.xml</include>
</theme>
```

### Theming multiple views simultaneously

Sometimes you want to apply the same properties to the same elements across multiple views.  The `name` attribute actually works as a list (delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas).  So, for example, to easily apply the same header to the basic, grid, and system views:

```xml
<view name="basic, grid, system">
    <image name="logo">
        <path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
    </image>
</view>
<view name="detailed">
    <image name="logo">
        <path>./snes_art/snes_header_detailed.png</path>
    </image>
</view>
```

This is equivalent to:
```xml
<view name="basic">
    <image name="logo">
        <path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
    </image>
</view>
<view name="detailed">
    <image name="logo">
        <path>./snes_art/snes_header_detailed.png</path>
    </image>
</view>
<view name="grid">
    <image name="logo">
        <path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
    </image>
</view>
<view name="system">
    <image name="logo">
        <path>./snes_art/snes_header.png</path>
    </image>
</view>
```



### Theming multiple elements simultaneously

You can theme multiple elements *of the same type* simultaneously.  The `name` attribute actually works as a list (delimited by any characters of `\t\r\n ,` - that is, whitespace and commas), just like it does for views, as long as the elements have the same type.  This is useful if you want to, say, apply the same color to all the metadata labels:

```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
    	<!-- Weird spaces/newline on purpose! -->
    	<text name="md_lbl_rating, md_lbl_releasedate, md_lbl_developer, md_lbl_publisher, md_lbl_genre, md_lbl_players, md_lbl_lastplayed, md_lbl_playcount">
        	<color>48474D</color>
        </text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Which is equivalent to:
```xml
<theme>
    <formatVersion>3</formatVersion>
    <view name="detailed">
    	<text name="md_lbl_rating">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_releasedate">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_developer">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_publisher">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_genre">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_players">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_lastplayed">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    	<text name="md_lbl_playcount">
    		<color>48474D</color>
    	</text>
    </view>
</theme>
```

Just remember, *this only works if the elements have the same type!*

### Element rendering order with z-index

You can now change the order in which elements are rendered by setting `zIndex` values.  Default values correspond to the default rendering order while allowing elements to easily be shifted without having to set `zIndex` values for every element.  Elements will be rendered in order from smallest z-index to largest.

### Theme static variables

Theme variables can be used to simplify theme construction.  
They must be used surrounded by ${ and }. ( ex : ${global.clock} }
There are 3 types of variables available.
* System Variables
* Theme Defined Variables

#### Built-in static variables

System variables can be used with variables, elements & if conditions.

* system.name
* system.fullName
* system.theme
* global.architecture
* global.help					( bool )
* global.clock				( bool )
* global.cheevos				( bool )
* global.cheevos.username
* global.netplay				( bool )
* global.netplay.username
* global.language
* screen.width				( float )
* screen.height				( float ) 
* screen.ratio
* screen.vertical             ( bool )
* system.cheevos				( bool )
* system.netplay				( bool )
* system.savestates			( bool )
* system.fullName
* system.group
* system.hardwareType
* system.manufacturer
* system.name
* system.releaseYear
* system.releaseYearOrNull
* system.sortedBy
* system.theme
* system.command
* cheevos.username
* `lang`  ** Batocera 5.24
* themePath                 (string)          root folder of the theme (not ending with /)             ** Batocera 5.39
* currentPath               (string)          folder of current  theme xml file (not ending with /)    ** Batocera 5.39 

#### Theme Defined Variables
Variables can also be defined in the theme.
```xml
<variables>
	<themeColor>8b0000</themeColor>
</variables>
```

#### Usage in themes
Variables can be used to specify the value of a theme property:
```xml
<color>${themeColor}</color>
```

or to specify only a portion of the value of a theme property:

```xml
<color>${themeColor}c0</color>
<path>./art/logo/${system.theme}.svg</path>
<path>./art/logo/${system.theme}-${lang}.svg</path> <!-- use it to select a localized image  -->
````

### Filter using attributes

System attributes allow filtering elements and adapt display under conditions :

These attributes apply to every XML element in the theme.

* `tinyScreen` - type : BOOLEAN
  
  Allow elements to be active only with small screens like GPI Case (if true), or disable element with normal screens ( if false )
  
* `ifHelpPrompts`- type : BOOLEAN
  
  Allow elements to be active only if help is visible/invisible in ES menus.
  
* `lang` - type : STRING
  Allow elements to be used only if the lang is the current language in EmulationStation.
  lang is 2 lower characters. ( fr, br, en, ru, pt.... )
  
* `ifSubset` - type : STRING
    
  Allow filtering elements in a xml file  when subsets are active.   
  
    ```xml
    <image ifSubset="systemview:horizontal|transparent|legacy, iconview=standard">
    ```
  
  name of the subset followed with  `:`  and the name value in the subset. To test multiple values, split with a comma `|`   
  To test multiple subsets, split with a comma `,` 
  
* `ifArch` - type : STRING

  Allow filtering elements in a xml file based on current architecture. The current list can be found in `getArchString()` at the bottom of [`platform.cpp`](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera-emulationstation/blob/master/es-core/src/platform.cpp)
  
    ```xml
    <path ifArch="rpi3,rpi4">./art/lowerspecimages/logo.png</path>
    ```

* `if` - type : STRING

  Allows to filter any element given a condition expression.
  
   ```xml
   <image if="${screen.height} >= 1080">
   ```
   
   ```xml
   <image if="${screen.ratio} == '16/9'">
   ```
  
  
#### Usage in themes

Variables can be used to specify the value of a theme property:

```xml
 <!-- Include GPICase settings -->
 <include tinyScreen="true">./gpicase.xml</include>
 
 <!-- Change size of grid if help is hidden -->
 <view name="grid" ifHelpPrompts="false">
    <imagegrid name="gamegrid">
      <size>0.950 0.84</size>
    </imagegrid>
  </view>
  
 <!-- Change text of extra item in french -->
 <text name="info" extra="true">
 	<text>Manufacturer</text>
 	<text lang="fr">Constructeur</text>
 <text>
```

or to specify only a portion of the value of a theme property:

#### screen

** BATOCERA 5.24

screen is a fixed view and has no themable properties. 

It is used to work like an OSD, to display elements like clock and controllers activity.

It can also contain text, image and video extras.

## Types of properties:

* NORMALIZED_PAIR - two decimals, in the range [0..1], delimited by a space.  For example, `0.25 0.5`.  Most commonly used for position (x and y coordinates) and size (width and height).
* NORMALIZED_RECT - four decimals, in the range [0..1], delimited by a space. For example, `0.25 0.5 0.10 0.30`.  Most commonly used for padding to store top, left, bottom and right coordinates. ** BATOCERA 5.24
* PATH - a path.  If the first character is a `~`, it will be expanded into the environment variable for the home path (`$HOME` for Linux or `%HOMEPATH%` for Windows).  If the first character is a `.`, it will be expanded to the theme file's directory, allowing you to specify resources relative to the theme file, like so: `./../general_art/myfont.ttf`.
* BOOLEAN - `true`/`1` or `false`/`0`.
* COLOR - a hexidecimal RGB or RGBA color (6 or 8 digits).  If 6 digits, will assume the alpha channel is `FF` (not transparent).
* FLOAT - a decimal.
* STRING - a string of text.


## Types of elements and their properties:

Common to almost all elements is a `pos` and `size` property of the NORMALIZED_PAIR type.  They are normalized in terms of their "parent" object's size; 99% of the time, this is just the size of the screen.  In this case, `<pos>0 0</pos>` would correspond to the top left corner, and `<pos>1 1</pos>` the bottom right corner (a positive Y value points further down).  `pos` almost always refers to the top left corner of your element.  You *can* use numbers outside of the [0..1] range if you want to place an element partially or completely off-screen.

The order you define properties in does not matter.
Remember, you do *not* need to specify every property!
*Note that a view may choose to only make only certain properties on a particular element themable!*

#### image

Can be created as an extra.

* `pos` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
* `size` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	
	- If only one axis is specified (and the other is zero), the other will be automatically calculated in accordance with the image's aspect ratio.
* `maxSize` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	
	- The image will be resized as large as possible so that it fits within this size and maintains its aspect ratio.  Use this instead of `size` when you don't know what kind of image you're using so it doesn't get grossly oversized on one axis (e.g. with a game's image metadata).
* `origin` - type: NORMALIZED_PAIR.
	
	- Where on the image `pos` refers to.  For example, an origin of `0.5 0.5` and a `pos` of `0.5 0.5` would place the image exactly in the middle of the screen.  If the "POSITION" and "SIZE" attributes are themable, "ORIGIN" is implied.

Animating elements using Storyboards
=========

** Batocera 29

You can now create animations using storyboards on every extra element & some built-in elements.

Storyboard example
--------------

Here is a very simple example of an animation that animates an image position, scale & opacity :

```xml
<theme>
	<formatVersion>7</formatVersion>
	<view name="detailed">
		<image name="my_image" extra="true">
			<pos>0.5 0.5</pos>
			<origin>0.5 0.5</origin>
			<size>0.8 0.8</size>
			<path>./my_art/my_awesome_image.jpg</path>            
            <storyboard>
        		<animation property="y" from="0.05" begin="0" duration="350" mode="easeOut"/>
        		<animation property="opacity" from="0" to="1" duration="350" mode="linear"/>
        		<animation property="scale" from="0" to="1" duration="350" mode="easeOut"/>
			</storyboard>
		</image>
	</view>
</theme>
```

The 'storyboard' element
------------

A storyboard is a set of animated properties. This element should contain child "animation" elements.

This element can be added to any common elements : image, video, text, datetime, rating, ninepatch, textlist, imagegrid. 

Only exceptions are : sound, menu, carousel, helpsystem and splash elements.

#### Attributes

* `event` -  type: STRING

  - Optional. Name of the event the storyboard applies to. 

    This value can be used in systemview's <image name="logo"> & <text name="logoText"> elements. In this case, value can be :

    - "activate"  : animation applies when a logo becomes active only
    - "deactivate" : animation applies when the active logo deactivates.
    - If the value is empty or if the attribute is missing, the storyboard applies to all logos.
    
    This value can be used in video elements : In this case, value can be :
    
    - "staticImage" : animation applies only to the static image behind the video
    - If the value is empty or if the attribute is missing, the storyboard applies to the video when it starts.
    
    In those case, multiple storyboards, each one with a different event is possible.

* `repeat` -  type: STRING or INTEGER
  
  - Optional. Tells if the storyboard repeats itself. If the value is empty or 1, there is no repeat. Value can also be "forever" or an integer value ( number of times the storyboard is repeated). This value is ignored if any of the animation elements has a repeat="forever" attribute.

The 'animation' element
------------

animation element must be a child of a storyboard.

This element is designed to set a list of properties to transform, given a timing, an acceleration curve, and a repeat information.

#### Attributes

* `property` -  type: STRING

  - Required : Name of the property to animate. 

    Value is one of the property in the object (pos, size, x, y, w, h, scale, scaleOrigin, color, opacity, rotation, rotationOrigin, zIndex...)

    Note : It's not possible to animate STRING and BOOLEAN properties. Only FLOAT, NORMALIZED_PAIR, NORMALIZED_RECT and COLOR elements can be animated.

* `from`-  type: DYNAMIC (uses the same type as the source property )
  
  * Optional. Tells the start value of the animation. If omitted, the value is taken in the control when the animation starts.
* `to`-  type: DYNAMIC (uses the same type as the source property )
  
  * Optional. Tells the end value of the animation. If omitted, the value is taken in the control when the animation starts.
* `begin`-  type: INTEGER
  
  * Optional. Tells when the animation should begin. This information is given in milliseconds. Default is 0 ( immediate ).
* `duration`-  type: INTEGER
  
  * Optional. Duration of the animation in millisecond. If the value is 0, the To value will be set at "begin" of this animation. Default is 0. 
* `repeat` -  type: STRING or INTEGER
  
  - Optional. Tells if the animation repeats itself. If the value is empty or 1, the animation won't be repeated. Value can also be "forever" to loop infinitely or an integer value which will be the number of times the storyboard is repeated. Default is 1. 
* `autoReverse`-  type: BOOLEAN
  
  * Optional. Determines whether the animation plays in reverse after it completes a forward iteration. Default is false.
* `mode`-  type: STRING

  - Optional. Defines the acceleration curve to apply. Default is "Linear".

    Value is one of :

    		Linear
    		EaseIn
    		EaseInCubic
    		EaseInQuint
    		EaseOut
    		EaseOutCubic
    		EaseOutQuint
    		EaseInOut
    		Bump


Resource overrides
==================

EmulationStation uses a few elements from its [resources](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera-emulationstation/tree/master/resources) folder (by default, `/etc/emulationstation/resources`) in order to draw on-screen elements. These include the little trophy/region/save file icons that appear next to a game's title and the "no boxart available" cartridge. If you would like to override these elements in your theme, simply include a `resources` folder in the root of your theme, and any files in there will take priority over files with the same filename in EmulationStation's resources folder.

Example:
```
...
      theme_set/
         resources/            
            cartridge.svg
```

This would replace the default cartridge image in the theme.

Show Empty Systems
==================

If you are creating per-system logos and would like to see what all systems look like in your theme on a live install without having to actually have ROMs in each system's folder, simply go to Main Menu → Game Collection Settings → Show Empty Systems
